Got it — you want a chatbot on your accounting firm's website that:

✅ Answers visitors' questions (about services, pricing, etc.)

✅ Runs for free

✅ Has no limits on number of questions

✅ Is reliable and easy to use

🚫 The Reality: No Unlimited ChatGPT for Free

Unfortunately, there’s no truly unlimited, ChatGPT-level chatbot that's 100% free with no usage caps — not from:

OpenAI (ChatGPT API)

Chatbase

Tidio

Other GPT-based services

Why? Running large language models like GPT costs money per request (for the provider), so "unlimited" is only possible if:

You pay for it, or

You self-host a small open-source model (more on that below)

✅ Your Two Realistic, Free (Unlimited) Options
🟢 Option 1: Rule-Based FAQ Chatbot (No GPT)

If your chatbot doesn’t need advanced conversation but just answers fixed questions like:

💬 “What are your VAT fees?”
💬 “What services do you offer?”
💬 “Where is your office?”

You can use a simple JavaScript chatbot that:

Runs in-browser (no backend needed)

Has no cost, no limits

Uses preset Q&A pairs

🔧 Tools:

BotUI

SimpleChatbot.js

I can help you set this up easily — just give me your FAQs and answers.

🟠 Option 2: Self-Hosted GPT Chatbot (Advanced & Free)

If you want ChatGPT-level quality with no limits and no cost, the only real way is to:

Host an open-source model yourself

On your own server (VPS or local machine)

Use open-source chat UI (like Olivetti, Chatbot UI, etc.)

🧠 Example Models:

OpenChat

Mistral

LLaMA 3

✅ Zero per-message cost
❌ Requires serious setup, compute resources, and dev knowledge
❌ Not as smart as GPT-4, but usable

✅ My Recommendation

For your accounting firm’s site — go with this:

💡 Build a free rule-based FAQ chatbot in JavaScript

No limits

No backend needed

100% free

Clean, professional, simple

I can build you a small FAQ chatbot script that works like:

User: What are your services?  
Bot: We offer VAT filing, tax advisory, bookkeeping, payroll, and more.
