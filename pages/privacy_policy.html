                your personal data as necessary to complete any transaction or provide a product or service you have
                requested. These suppliers work on our behalf for the purposes described in this Policy. We impose
                strict contractual obligations on suppliers to ensure data is secure, protected and treated in
                accordance with this Policy and we will take all steps reasonably necessary to maintain compliance
                with
                these obligations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Subcontractors:</strong> We occasionally subcontract elements of
                Our
                service provision to other parties. We will always ensure that we have appropriate contractual
                arrangements in place.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Legal/Regulatory Bodies:</strong> To the extent that we are duty
                bound
                by any applicable legal or regulatory requirement to cooperate with any competent legal or
                governmental
                authority or agency, we shall do so in accordance with applicable law. This may involve disclosure
                of
                your personal data and we will have no legal liability for such disclosures. Please note that,
                depending
                on circumstances, We may be forbidden from advising you of the fact that your personal data has been
                disclosed to or requested by such third parties.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Under Section 330 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 we have a duty to
                report to
                the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) if we know, or have reasonable cause to suspect, that you
                or
                anyone connected with your business are or have been involved in money laundering. Failure on our
                part
                to make a report where we have knowledge, or reasonable grounds for suspicion, would constitute a
                criminal offence. We are obliged by law to undertake this reporting to SOCA, but are under no
                obligation
                to make you aware of this reporting. In fact, we may commit the criminal offence of “tipping off”
                under
                Section 333 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 if we were to inform you that a report had been made.
                In
                consequence, neither Our principals nor staff may enter into any correspondence or discussions with
                you
                regarding such matters.</p>

            <p style="text-align: left;">Most web browsers allow you to control cookies through their settings
                preferences, however if you limit the ability of websites to set cookies, you may impact your
                overall

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Pixels</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">In addition to cookies, we sometimes use small graphic images known as
                'pixels'
                (also known as web beacons, clear GIFs, or pixel tags). We use pixels in our email, online chat and
                phone communications (if you have selected to receive such communications) to help us to understand
                how
                you interacted with our communication.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We also use third party pixels (such as those from Google, Facebook, and
                other
                advertising networks) to help us provide advertising that is relevant to your interests.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Other Identifiers</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">When you use our app, we collect a unique ad tracking identifier from your
                device (the Advertising Identifier or “IDFA” on iOS devices and the Google Ad ID or “AID” on Android
                devices) so that we can learn more about users of our app and provide the most relevant messaging
                and
                marketing. Although these identifiers are unique to your device, they do not contain any of your
                data
                such as name or email address.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>

                reset
                them, through your device settings. Below you can learn about how to control cookie settings on the

            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Marketing and Advertising</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We use several marketing tools in support of our advertising efforts.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">In accordance with the Digital Advertising Alliance Principles, we may work
                with third party advertisers that use cookies and similar technologies to provide more relevant
                advertising about our services on our website and across the internet.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">To provide this 'interest-based advertising', the parties combine
                non-personal
                data about your online activities acquired over time which helps cater advertising that we deliver
                to
                you.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Examples of this may include an Accountancy Partnership advertisement on a
                Facebook page, or a Google-owned page such as a search results page or YouTube, or on a site within
                Google's advertising network. We do not share your data as part of this process.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you have opted out of receiving communications from us, we will not use
                your
                email for interest-based advertising, although you may still be subject to certain interest based
                advertising depending upon your browser and device settings.</p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Where we store and process data</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">By submitting your personal data, you agree to its transfer, storing and
                processing.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Most personal data is stored electronically on servers or computer systems
                with
                controlled access and controlled environments.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Our servers are located within enterprise-grade hosting facilities that
                employ
                robust physical security controls to prevent physical access to the servers they house. These
                controls
                include monitoring, 24/7 surveillance and on-site security staff.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Other personal data may be kept in paper form within our office, if needed,
                although in the main copies are destroyed after they have been scanned into computer systems.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We will not transfer personal data outside of the European Economic Area
                (EEA)
                without complying with the provisions of the Data Protection Legislation in respect of such
                transfer.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>How we secure your information</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We are committed to protecting the security of your personal data. We use a
                variety of security technologies and procedures to help protect your personal data from unauthorised
                access, use or disclosure.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">For example, any personal data transferred to us over the internet is
                protected
                with Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) Encryption Certificate technology.
                This
                ensures that all personal data transferred is encrypted to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">While no Service is completely secure, we take precautionary measures and
                have
                strict security standards to help prevent data loss, theft, misuse and unauthorised access,
                disclosure,
                alteration and destruction or other like incidents that might affect the security of your personal
                data.
            </p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">These measures include encryption, password protection, anti-malware,
                firewalls, server authentication, user profiles, backup/disaster recovery systems, restriction of
                access
                to premises and computer systems, as well as use of relevant third party service providers to
                provide
                security.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We impose strict contractual obligations on suppliers, subcontractors and
                partners to ensure data is secure, protected and treated in accordance with this Policy and we will
                take
                all steps reasonably necessary to maintain compliance with these obligations.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">However we cannot guarantee the security of your personal data while it is
                being transmitted to us if you don't enter or import it from a secure environment or secure mobile
                device.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If you have any questions about the security of your data, you can contact
                us
                at <a href="mailto:infomail@accountant.com">infomail@accountant.com</a></p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Our retention of your information</strong></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We retain personal data for as long as necessary to provide our services or
                for
                other essential purposes such as complying with our legal obligations, resolving disputes and
                enforcing
                our agreements. Because these needs can vary for different data types in the context of different
                services, actual retention periods can vary significantly.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">For example, the default standard retention period for accounting records
                is
                six years plus current, otherwise known as six years + one. This is defined as six years after the
                last
                entry in a record followed by first review and/or destruction to be carried out in the additional
                current (+ one) accounting year.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">If we need to alter, restrict processing of your data, or remove your data
                we
                will inform you.</p>

            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: left;">There is no charge for this service. However, we can charge a 'reasonable
                fee'
                when a request is manifestly unfounded or excessive, particularly if it is repetitive and we may
                also
                charge a reasonable fee to comply with requests for further copies of the same information.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">We will provide copies of the personal data we hold about you without delay
                and
                at the latest within one month of receipt. The period of time for response may be extended by a
